      <description>If you’ve ever been beach-combing, anywhere in the world, chances are you’ve picked up bivalve shells. Bivalves are a group of animals that includes familiar things like scallops, oysters, mussels, clams and cockles.
(If you already know what a bivalve is and how Linnaean taxonomy works, you can safely skip this post!)
The defining character of the group is that they have two shells - other kinds of mollusc have one, or eight, or none - hence bi (two) valve (shell).</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Katie and I&amp;rsquo;m a paleontologist specialising in the benthic shelled molluscs (also known as clams and snails). You can find more about my research here. This blog is a place for me to talk a little more informally about my favourite squishy critters. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s under construction, but check back soon! I will be posting about how benthic molluscs live, how to identify their shells if you find them on the beach, and what they can tell us about the world of today, and the past.</description>
