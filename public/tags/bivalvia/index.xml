      <description>If you’ve ever been beach-combing, anywhere in the world, chances are you’ve picked up bivalve shells. Bivalves are a group of animals that includes familiar things like scallops, oysters, mussels, clams and cockles.
(If you already know what a bivalve is and how Linnaean taxonomy works, you can safely skip this post!)
The defining character of the group is that they have two shells - other kinds of mollusc have one, or eight, or none - hence bi (two) valve (shell).</description>
