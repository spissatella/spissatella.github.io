Hi! I'm Katie and I'm a paleontologist specialising in the benthic shelled molluscs (also known as clams and snails). You can find more about my research [**here**](https://home.uchicago.edu/~kscollins/index.html). This blog is a place for me to talk a little more informally about my favourite squishy critters. Right now it's under construction, but check back soon! I will be posting about how benthic molluscs live, how to identify their shells if you find them on the beach, and what they can tell us about the world of today, and the past.
